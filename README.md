# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project focused on predicting the presence of heart disease using clinical and diagnostic data. The project emphasizes exploratory data analysis, model interpretability,
and responsible use of machine learning in a healthcare context.

## Project Highlights
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis with medical interpretation
- Careful feature engineering and preprocessing
- Comparison of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM)
- Logistic Regression selected based on perfect recall and interpretability
- Actionable hospital recommendations derived from data insights

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Note
This model is intended as a decision-support tool and does not replace clinical diagnosis.
